# Educator-Live-Coding-Tool
A Live Coding Tool for Educators

This presentation reflects my journey through CSC 299 in a video debrief and essay style. It specifically focuses on developing the Live Educator Coding Tool, which was developed throughout the term. The project was initially proposed to provide a tool to assist teachers in teaching coding to youth, but it quickly expanded into getting a proof of concept of applying it generally. Additionally, it was a great experience to eventually transition into CSC 499 and real-world experience.


There were several developmental milestones – and setbacks – throughout the development of the tool. Early on, creating and managing the server side was the priority. Though that came with a lot of redesign and refactoring. Issues regarding scaling, dynamic elements, and having a single server and a single client arose. Furthermore, changing these connections proved difficult. Incorporating that concurrency between users was also a large challenge to run smoothly and easily. Quite a few milestones arose from moving away from a naive approach to a more robust, clever, or even theoretical approach.
Overall, this project allowed me to prove that the “proof of concept” originally proposed, which excites me for what is to come. Outside of the project, it has also developed proficiencies in many applicable skills like problem-solving, management, and critical thinking, while providing experience with working on a large-scale project. Showing that it is possible to create that tool capable of helping others.
